## Diffusion Tesnsor Imaging (DTI) Probabilistic Tractography Analysis
**Project:** White Matter Connectivity Differences in Face Processing Cortical Brain Network Between Preterm and Term Born Neonates. 
This repository focuses on extracting regions of interest from the Edinburg Neonatal Atlas (ENA), matching the regions of interest with 
Edinburg Neonatal Atlas scans and conducting probabilistic tractography.
**Aim of this repository:** Creating a pipeline to conduct probabilistic tractography in the regions of interest (ROIs) - fusiform face area (FFA), occipital fusiform area (OFA), posterior superior temporal sulcus (PSTS) and primary visual pathway (V1), extracted from the Edinburg Neonatal Atlas (ENA) atlas, in the Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data of neonates taken from the developmental human connectome project (dHPC).
